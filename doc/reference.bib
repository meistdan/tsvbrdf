		implemented to reduce the computational expense of
		producing ray-traced images. The selection of bounding
		volumes is examined to reduce the computational cost of
		the ray-intersection test. The use of object coherence,
		which relies on a hierarchical description of the
		environment, is then presented. Finally, since the
		building of the ray-intersection trees is such a large
		portion of the computation, a method using image
		coherence is described. This visible-surface
		preprocessing method, which is dependent upon the
		creation of an `item buffer,'' takes advantage of {\em
		a priori} image formation. Examples that indicate the
		efficiency of these techniques for a variety of
		representative environments are presented.",
