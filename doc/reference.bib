	abstract = {We consider the problem of modeling objects composed of materials that change over the course of time. First principles simulation of the processes that cause material change are either extraordinarily time consuming or impossible because the processes are not thoroughly understood. We take the approach of capturing the time variation of materials undergoing particular changes in appearance. We control and/or measure the relevant parameters that produce the changes. Some parameters may be independent of the object shape, such as thickness of a coating applied, while others depend on the shape. We use the data collected to generate synthetic objects composed of the same materials. The objects can be rendered at different steps in their history, with the material changes being unique to the shape and conditions of that object.},
